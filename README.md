Hi, I’m @Fannzxyl.

I have a strong interest in technology, with a primary focus on mobile and web development. I also enjoy exploring the game development space and have a personal interest in anime and manga, which often inspire my creativity.

I am currently committed to continuous learning, actively developing my programming skills and deepening my understanding of modern technologies.

I am open to collaboration, particularly on open-source projects related to Android development, web development, or game development.
